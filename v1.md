On the evening of March twenty six, two thousand thirteen, Brian Williams 
appeared on Late Night With David Letterman. We're very happy 
to have this man go with us. He is the Emmy and Peabody Award winning anchor 
and managing editor of the NBC Nightly News Latest. Gentlemen, here he is,
our good friend Brian Williams, Mr Williams. Brian Williams looks like a TV anchor.
He has one of those rectangular super handsome made for television heads,
maybe two sizes larger than normal. Like he inflates it with a bicycle pump
before he goes on camera. And he's charming, very charming. Congratulations.
Twenty years at NBC News. Thank you very. Young William sits down next to Letterman
and the two of them chitchat Until jokes, there had been some big kerfuffle
about the Today show involving Matt Lauer and Letterman tries and fails to bait
Williams into saying something juicy about it. Now, if I'm on to something, blink twice.
Then Letterman asked the question that will destroy Brian Williams career.
Tell me on If I knew this, I forgot it. And if I forgot, I'm ashamed.
Something happened ten years ago in Iraq. Tell people what that occur.
I brought a photo which arrived in my e mail two mornings ago of where I was tonight,
a decade ago, this very day, this very day. My name is Malcolm Gladwell.
You're listening to revisionist history, my podcast about things for gotten
and misunderstood thiss episode his part two of my exploration of memory
and our naive ideas about what memory is worth. If you haven't heard the previous episode,
you should listen to it first. It's the story of an early morning raid on a Nazi hideout in Munich,
a raid that involved a world class harmonica player and a dashingly handsome undercover spy.
The lesson of that story is it only a fool accept the evidence of his own memory is gospel.
The lesson of this story is we're all fools. This was me ten years ago. And a young command sergeant Major,
I was in Iraq now. Ah, couple of caveats here a CZ War Correspondents go.
I am the Herb hsi men drink of war correspondents I am. I'm not terribly good at it.
It is not what I do full time. I am mostly New York based. I do go cover these two wars
we've been fighting. And when I do, I like to go out on patrol. I like to get out in it.
We were in some helicopters. We were going to drop some bridge portions across the Euphrates
so the third Infantry could cross on them. Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire,
including the one I was in, No RPG and forty seven. As you may remember, the helicopter Brian Williams
was riding was not, in fact, hit by ground fire. Williams was miles away in another aircraft entirely.
When the attack happened. One of the most respected network news anchors went on late night TV to tell
a story about his near death experience. And it turned out not to be true. What happens?
The minute everybody realizes you've been hit We figure out howto land safely and we did.
We landed very quickly and hard and we put down and we were stuck. Four birds in the middle
of the desert and we were north out ahead of the other Americans. Oh, a za guy as a journalist.
What do you think? This is a great position to be in our holy crap? I got to get out of my idea
more toward the holy crowd. This is what we know for certain about the case of Brian Williams
and a helicopter. Our colleague Brian Limbs is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call
in the skies over Iraq. Brian, tell us about what you've got yourself into. Well, in the end, Tom,
it did give us a glimpse. Just after the U. S. Invasion of Iraq began in the spring of two thousand three, Williams
filed a report for NBC News from the field. He described how he'd been embedded with a convoy of four Chinook
helicopters flying out of Kuwait City. They were carrying bridge components so that the U. S. Army troops
could cross the Euphrates. This is Williams reporting March twenty six, two thousand three. On the ground, we learned
the Chinook ahead of us was almost blown out of the sky. That hole was made by a rocket propelled grenade, or RPG.
As William's describes it, all four helicopters ended up on the desert floor. There was a massive sandstorm.
They were trapped there for three harrowing days. The main invading force was still miles away.
What we didn't know was we were north of the invasion. We were the northern most Americans in Iraq.
Williamses account is included in a book published by NBC shortly after four years later, 
he tells it again in a block post written after the death of a retired general who was in the helicopter with him.
Only this time Williams uses a vague sentence. There was small arms fire in a later block post. In two thousand eight.
He's more explicit. All four of our low flying Chinooks took fire. We were forced down and stayed down.
Then Letterman two thousand thirteen. Brian Williams faithful appearance. So we got hit. We set down.
Everyone was okay. Our captain took a purple heart injury to his ear in the cockpit, but we were alone. 
They started distributing weapons. We heard a noise, and it was Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks coming. 
They happen to spot us. This was the invasion. Got the U. S. Invasion. They saw us. Suddenly, a story that Williams
has been telling in bits and pieces gets told in a spotlight of late night TV. And who sees it? Lance Reynolds,
the flight engineer on the helicopter that got hit. Reynolds responds on NBC's Facebook page. Sorry, dude,
I don't remember you being on my aircraft. I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed
to ask me what happened. One by one, the members of the flight crew's involved come forward to say the same thing.
And then the scandal tell me, do you know where Brian Williams was at the moment that your helicopter
was hit by the RPG? That's Brian Stelter of CNN interviewing Don Hellis, the pilot of the lead helicopter.
Well, we had a lot going on, but I am pretty sure he was not in our flight at all. Then Stelter talks to the pilot
of the helicopter that Williams was on. His name is Alan Kelly. Is it right to say that Brian Williams was aboard
your helicopter and not aboard the helicopter that was shot at in Iraq that day? That's correct.
He was aboard my aircraft that day in March. What was your aircraft doing? And was it ever within sight
of the Chinook that was shot at a ce faras the Chinook from big windy that was shot down? We were not within
visual range of them. So what sort of distance was there between your helicopter with Brian Williams aboard
and the helicopter that did take fire so initially were probably a half hour behind them. Soon every pundit
under the sun is wagging a disdainful finger. There's Don Imus. Tell me what you think. I don't remember whether
or not you're in a plane that gets him. I can. You not remember that? Remember getting punched in the face.
And in the fourth grade, Rosie O'Donnell, I think you would know if you were in a helicopter that
was actually hit by a missile, so I don't think he did it. Remember that? I think he fabricated that story.
Jon Stewart. We got us a case here of infotainment confusion syndrome. It occurs when the celebrity cortex
gets its wires crossed with the medulla anchor dolla, even Whoopi Goldberg. When he first told the story,
he told the story as it happened. And every time he told it again, it got Mohr exciting. He was war.
This was more than and by the time he was finished, he was on the helicopter. I'm sorry.
You know, it's it's stolen valor. You Khun, get around. So if you impersonate a soldier's say you were in combat,
you can actually get arrested and charged and put in jail for doing just what he did. I know he's reprehensible.
He's disgusting and like it was a lying coward. He's been telling this story for twelve years.
This goes on from months. NBC suspends him six months without pay, culminating with a public penance
on the Today show. Matt Lauer in the interviewer's seat. What have these past five months been like for you?
It has been torture. Now maybe you don't care about Brian Williams. Ah, lot has happened since his scandal.
He currently has a nightly show on MSNBC at eleven Eastern. He's going to be fine in the grand scheme of things.
What does it matter? Well, it matters because of what the case exposes about our understanding of memory.
Brian Williams remembered a traumatic event one way. Then a couple of years later, he started remembering
that same event a different way, and the assumption of virtually everyone who weighed in on the case was this.
If someone changes their original story, then they must be lying. But the change must be deliberate
and self aggrandizing. Everyone assumes memory is a kind of time stamped video of what happened in your life
and that if you contradict the evidence of the video, you're up to no good. I'm sorry, but that's insane.
Free Brian Williams. I'm going to ask you a series of questions about the morning of September eleventh, two thousand one.
I'm talking with my friend Deedee Gordon. I've known her forever. How did you first learn about the attack
on the towers? Um, I had just taking my dogs out for a walk, and I had bought the New York Post,
The New York Times. And remember, Paris Hilton was on the cover than your post, I think.
And I went and I, you know, took my walk around the block, and I came up to my apartment,
and I was like sitting at my town or reading the newspapers, and I saw all these people standing out on Hudson Street
staring up in the middle of street, that And so hi, I poked my head out the window.
I couldn't really see what was going on. And then I turned on the television and, um, you know, saw what was happening.
What did you do next? I went up and, you know, I either called ur went up to your apartment.
I can't remember. It was one of the It was one of two things either.
I think I called you I think I called you because you're upstairs. Deedee Gordon and I
used to live in the same building in the West Village above a bodega. Whenever she came up to see me,
she was sing the theme song from the sitcom three's company. Come and knock on our door
where you call me before you went on on the street or after you in industry. I called you before.
Oh, did I? And did I picked up. You did. And I was like, You need Teo, Look out your window
And you didn't turn on the news. Did you see me that morning or did you leave before I came down?
Now we we saw each other and you were like, Well, I got to go fly someplace today,
and I remember I said to you I go what? And, you know, the airports were closed.
You're like, Oh, I guess I'll leave tomorrow morning And I said, Oh, like you're going to get on a plane
like I thought you were crazy. And you said, Gordon, this is the safest time to fly remember that.
No, I don't. You know, So first, your memory for this stuff is kind of phenomenal.
How certain are you about all of those memories? You just told me. How certain am I?
I'm pretty certain. Now, let me ask you the same questions. I was just asking DD How did you first learn
about what happened on nine eleven? Where were you? What were you doing? How did you feel when you first became aware of the attack? Who was the first person you talked to about the attack? What were you doing immediately before you became aware of it? I'm going to guess that many of you can answer every one of those questions. Maybe not with the same specificity is DD because she has an amazing memory. But you could tell me where you were when you heard the news. I was in bed. Did he called me? I went down to Hudson Street and stood in the crowd watching the twin towers burn. Then I went down to a little coffee shop around the corner from my house and sat there with a cup of tea in numb silence. Nine eleven is what's called a flashbulb event, a big dramatic incident that sears itself into our memories and is a whole subspecialty in psychology devoted to the study of flashbulb memory. You ask someone where they were right after something dramatic or historic happened. Then you come back to them months or years later and asked them again and measure how accurate their memories are. There have been countless studies like this over the years. One was done after the death of Princess Di, another after the resignation of Margaret Thatcher, the challenger explosion, the fall of the Berlin Wall, the election of Barack Obama, the OJ Simpson verdict. Not surprisingly, there was one done after nine eleven as well. So nine eleven happened, and I got together with a former student of mine. And why you? Liz Phelps? The nine eleven project was headed by Bill Hearst from the New School and Liz Phelps at New York University. I went to see Hurst, and he told me that he and Phelps had come up with the idea over dinner on September twelfth in a restaurant close enough to the towers that you could smell the smoke, her says that he and Phelps realised they could do the mother of all flashbulbs studies. So the next day they reached out to colleagues around the country. Boston, New Haven, New York, Washington. See St Louis, Palo Alto and Santa Cruz. A total of three thousand two hundred forty six subjects asked the same questions. I just asked you Where were you? Who you with? How did you feel? No. The participants were asked the same questions a year later and two years later and finally on the tenth anniversary of the attack in twenty eleven. So what did the researchers find? Well, first that everyone knows where they were when they heard the towers fell. Just like me and Edie. It's burned into memory. But are those memories accurate? No, they're not. Especially in the first year, after a flashbulb event, all kinds of discrepancies creep in. One of the respondents first said she was in the kitchen making breakfast when she heard about the attack. A year later, she swore she was in the laundry room, folding your clothes. Another said in two thousand one that she saw the attack while watching the Today show. A year later, she was convinced that a girl in her dorm had rushed into her room and told her, So. When we look at these kinds of inaccuracies, inconsistencies that creep into how large is the variability among the subjects. Those two say, Do we have some who get everything wrong in retrospect? And someday I'm gonna write, you know, I would say that the variability is fairly small. Some people get everything right. Some people get more wrong, but it's not a huge variability. Hearst finds, on average a sixty percent decline in memory consistency, meaning sixty percent of the answer's changed over time. You would think that everything about nine eleven would be seared into our minds one of the most dramatic days of our generation, but everything is not. Second thing even more crucial, are we aware that our memories of nine eleven are flawed? No, we're not. Our confidence in the accuracy of our memories of that day is sky high. They're super high. Yeah, and why we'll be at miss of a dumb question, but walk me through. Why are they so high? Hearst says nine eleven is like a death in the family. We feel we have a responsibility to remember If you had only vague memories of where you were when you found out your mother died, Well, I would think Like what? What kind of person are you? How could you not remember that our New Yorkers conference levels higher? Forget everybody's confidence level is so high. So it's hard to differentiate too. Yeah, we're all absolutely sure about what happened to us on nine. Eleven. My friend did. He can talk about that morning Justus, if it were yesterday and I will swear on a stack of Bibles that she called me on the phone. And then I ran downstairs and then eventually ended up sitting numb and alone in a coffee shop. And yet it is almost certainly the case that we are wrong on at least half of those details. It did not happen that way. Per says that the participants in flashbulb studies refused to accept this fact. They will not admit that their memories are wrong. Take the flashbulb study done after the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in nineteen eighty six. The psychologist in charge sat down with people months later and showed them how differently they describe things right after the disaster. He showed them what they actually wrote. He says. It's Is it their handwriting on DH? They say Yes, but I don't know why I wrote that because it's wrong, You know, I agree. It's my handwriting. I agree. I must have written that, but I don't know why I lied because I clearly remember I was in the dorm even though this piece of paper says I was in the cafeteria. So this is overwhelming confidence that people have now, why are we so adamant on the subject of memory? Because we're memory fundamentalists. We think our memory is a camera recording our life in real time with a video time stamped and stored for later retrieval. It's not like memories when you remember something, you're retrieving it and it remains absolutely stable. And then you put it in the footlights of your consciousness. It xhm, or that when you retrieve it is open up to the possibility of change every time we retrieve a memory, In other words, there's a chance it can get contaminated. We hear some new details somewhere about the event, and without realizing it, we just added in memory. Researchers talk a lot about what they call time slice Ares. A couple of things happen in the same general timeframe on we get the sequence all jumbled up. Didi says she and I talked in person that morning of nine eleven. I have no recollection of it, but she does. I'm almost positive we spoke inside the apartment here. Yeah, and then I really said I was getting on a plane the next day. Oh, yeah, and you were, like, kind of cocky about it, too. You're like you kind of looked at me like Gordon. Stop being so neurotic. Hey, and you're like, don't you know this is the safest time to get on an airplane is when something like this happens, you can be really quite condescending. Turns out it's my favorite thing about you. I decided to do a little fact checking. I still have my date books from two thousand won. I'm pretty meticulous about keeping track of my travel, and I did not have an airplane trip planned for September twelfth. No, maybe I'm mistaken. Maybe Daddy's right, but according to my records, I flew to Montreal on September nineteenth, eight days later. I think our conversation about flights must have been right before that trip, because why would I say it's the safest time to fly on the morning of nine eleven? That's something you would only say after the airport's had re opened. Yeah, with much tighter security, I think. Did he made a time slice their att's? Some point she mistakenly moved that memory to the morning of nine eleven because it seems plausible that we would have talked about planes that morning. Now does that make DD a liar. Is she working some self promoting angle? DD is one of the most honest people I've ever met. She simply did what human beings do when it comes to traumatic events, there is our memory and there is the truth and the two are not the same. Okay, so what if it's not nine eleven? What if it's a couple of years later, at the very beginning of the Iraq war? What if I'm in a convoy of helicopters deep in enemy territory, scared out of my wits and the helicopter ahead of me gets hit and I'm a reporter and I interview lots of people that day about what happened and retell the story so many times that their details become my details. And I start to think that it was my helicopter that got hit when I read your paper. The first person to kingdom mind is Brian Williams. Yes, yes. Didn't he just committed and incredibly normal human? Yes. That was my view. Andi was view of most of the people in the memory feel that I know you're of the mind that he genuinely believed the story as he told it. Yes, now do you see Brian Williams predicament? Everyone thinks he's lying in order to paint himself as some heroic war correspondent, but he doesn't think he's lying. He honestly believes he was in the lead helicopter with the same confidence we all have in our flashbulb memories. DD remembers playing his day that I was catching a flight on September twelve. People in flashbulb studies look at their own handwriting from years earlier and say, That can't be right. That's not how I remember it. And on Thursday, NBC News announced that Brian Williams, a twenty two year veteran of this network, would not be returning, is the anchor of NBC Nightly News. He steps down When Brian Williams does his penance on the Today show in mid two thousand thirteen, he and Matt Lauer go around and around in circles. I told the story correctly for years before I told it incorrectly, I was not trying to mislead people. That to me, is a huge difference here. But Matt Lauer is having none of it. I worried as you say, this, Brian, that people who are going to have listened to your apology on air and in other areas Facebook and Stars and Stripes who heard you use words like inflated aircraft or or made mistakes with my memory of certain things. They're now going to hear what you're saying now when they're going to say he's still saying he didn't intend to mislead people and yet he didn't tell the truth. And he had to know Is the guy who lived through those experiences that it wasn't the truth he had to know as the guy who lived through those experiences, that it wasn't the truth? No, that's one hundred percent wrong. What should Matt Lauer have said? He should have said Brian. Memory is fallible. You're a public figure, for goodness sake. The next time you go on national TV to tell a war story, go back and check to see if your story is accurate. But lower doesn't say that the Today show interview was build is tough minded, uncompromising journalism. It was actually the opposite. An interrogation about memory conducted by someone who hasn't the slightest clue how memories work. And what is Brian Williams supposed to do? He has no defense. All they could do is debase himself. I understand it. This came from clearly a bad place, a bad urge inside me. This was clearly ego driven, the desire to better my role in a story I was already in. That's what I've been tearing apart and unpacking. This comes from clearly a bad place once again. Wrong. It comes from the most human of places. And Matt Lauer. Matt Lauer, for heaven's sake, puts on the high hat. Several days after you told the story on nightly news, you went on the air and you apologized. And I just said, You use terms like I'm mistaken. I was mistaken in my recollections. Did you give thought at the time to going on the air and saying I lied? Matt Lauer, by the way, had an entire staff whose job it was to prepare him for interviews. This research on memory is not a secret. Bill Hearst is at the new School on fourteenth Street and Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Co author Lis Phelps is an N U down the street from Rockefeller Center, where the Today show is taped, two of the world's leading experts on memory are four subway stops away on the B or D trains. On a nice day, lower could have walked it. How hard is this not to put words in your mouth? But had you gone on the air that night and say, Folks, I lied and I'm sorry. Do you think the outcome would have been different? Do you think forgiveness would have come sooner? Except he didn't lie. Lying in this instance would be Brian Williams pretending that he deliberately made up that story. So Matt Lauer is saying that he would rather Williams had lied and confessed that he'd lied rather than having told the truth that he honestly thought he was telling the truth. The Council of Cardinals could not make sense of the moral logic of that By the way, it's worth noting that the whole Brian Williams saga is a case study in memory failure. CNN's Brian Stelter interviews Don Hellis, the pilot of the helicopter that got shot down. He asked Ellis when he first heard Brian Williams mischaracterizing what happened. And Hella says, Oh, a few weeks later, when I got back to Kuwait, meaning in two thousand three, This is This is crucial, Mr. Hell is because, according to the timeline that we've been looking at for the past several days, it wasn't until about two thousand seven that Brian Williams began to embellish this story about being actually nearby, or even on the chopper that was struck by the RPG. You're saying you heard it on television in two thousand three twelve, saying, I heard on the Internet that was an interview over an Internet video of the television segment. Yes, Stelter is way too nice to say it, but hell, this can't be right. His recollection is off by four years, and does he realize how badly he's misremembered the date? It's no, he's adamant. Then another man comes forward. The pilot of William's helicopter and claims they did take small arms fire goes on CNN, add some gossipy details. Then a day later, the pilot takes it all back. Quote. The information I gave you was true, based on my memories, but at this point I'm questioning my memories, which might be the first self aware things said by anyone during this whole sorry affair. In the Brian Williams case, everyone was allowed to have a bad memory except Brian Williams. So I had a hard on him. But I did think of this. If he was treated very unfair. He wants, I think, absolutely well, I'm waiting to see the formation of cognitive psychologist for Brian Williams has a lobby group. I was. I was thinking of doing it. I felt so sorry for him. Thanks for doing this, Rose. Thank you for doing this. Run in and thank you, everybody for coming. Not long ago, after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke, I went to a talk in Manhattan at the ninety second Street. Why? It was a conversation between Rose McGowan, who was the first actress to go on the record with accusations against Weinstein, and Ronan Farrow, who wrote the definitive, devastating account of the Weinstein case for the New Yorker magazine. It was a fascinating and sometimes strange evening. MacGowan speaks in a kind of elliptical poetry. It's not always obvious what she means. Pharaoh was a lawyer before he turned to journalism. His rigorous I in a Someone asked me if you were in Oz, Who would you be? Who would you be? Roast curtain. I would be the curtain You're not the man behind the curtain. You are the Kirk. I am the curtain. The card is very pretty. Curtain gets used. Kicked aside. Nobody really notices the curtain. They're appreciative that it's there. But it is. Pull inside, stunk put. It absorbs everything from both sides from this side. Presentational, look so great, T right. This is the curtain that you see from the back side. You see everything, too. But nobody knows his curtains. The curtain's taking notes. McGowan is someone who requires an interpreter. And there was one moment that really struck me when Farrow talked about what being an interpreter meant. He was trying to get people at NBC, where he worked at the time to take McGowan's accusations seriously. I spent a year listening to a lot of powerful men. Call these women who were relating the worst experiences of a lifetime crazy. Call them unstable, call them unreliable narrators and a lot worse things that I won't repeat on this stage. You know, that was something that was lobbed at your story. Countless times. I sat in rooms and defended the fact that that on the record testimony from you matter and what you see people like NBC. A few minutes later, the two of them start talking about what it takes for a story like McGowan's to break through all the skepticism and indifference for I think when women come forward individually and they do a block post for social media post and tell their story, that's great. But the question is its then incumbent on reporters to do right by that and the best way to do justice. I think tow any person coming forward with a difficult story is to interrogate it as thoroughly as possible and, you know, lend credence to court where it's due. One of the battle cries of the fight against sexual predation has been believed the women. But notice? That's not what Farrow is saying he did, he says. The best way to do justice to any person coming forward with a difficult story is to interrogate it as thoroughly as possible and lend credence where it's due. Pharaoh didn't believe Rose McGowan Farrell listened to Rose McGowan. He took her seriously. That's what memory demands. What if Rose MacGowan had said that she'd been assaulted by Weinstein in a hotel room in Paris, and it turned out to have been in London, and she said it had happened in March, and it turned out to be July. Can you imagine her on today's show, twisting and turning as she tries to defend that lapse in memory to Matt Lauer? You said you were in Paris. You were miles away in London. You had to know is the woman who lived through those experiences that it wasn't the truth. But remembering yourself in one place when you were actually in another does not mean that you're lying. It just means that uncovering the truth requires an understanding of what memory can and cannot do. If we don't get the small cases right, the Brian Williams cases, we're going to be helpless at the big cases. Looking back, it had to have been ego that made me think I had to be sharper. Funnier, quicker. Uh, then anybody else put myself closer to the action, having been at the action in the beginning. Oh, please stop apologizing for a crime you didn't commit free Brian Williams. Revisionist history is a panoply production senior producer. His meal. A bell with Jacob Smith and Camille Baptista. Our editor is Julia Barton Flan. Williams is our engineer. Fact Checking by Beth Johnson. Original Music by Luis Keira. Special Thanks to Andy Bowers and Jake Weisberg, I'm out. Home. So what's interesting is so I'm sure you called me. And you're sure you called me? But there's a chance. I'm almost one hundred percent positive. I called you, and I am. I am too. But there is a chance that you didn't call me. There isn't a chance, because I know I called you. I know you called me too, but I know I know it's incredibly hard to deal with, but it's like there's a chance you didn't. I mean, there's a chance you're not to my door, you know? But then I started thinking about did I really not going to store because I respected your privacy as you respected mine. And I would have never, just want went up to knock on your door, just in case that you had, like, a lady up there or something. So in respect for that, I would have probably called you first. Just not even if he not even if, like the Twin Towers air smoking on, you know, I would have not walked upstairs to interrupt your your intimate moment with a lady friend even if the twin towers were on fire. But please don't conclude that in your podcast. No, no, wait, wait. You know what this is? Yeah.
